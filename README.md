We studied the abundance, diversity and influence of physicochemical parameters on juvenile fish species in BSJ, 
based on abundance data collected during two beach seine fishing surveys conducted over two consecutive seasons in 2020. 
We first, analysed the variability over the seasons and between sampling sites the physicochemical parameters, 
the diversity of juvenile fish assemblages (alpha diversity).
Then we analysed the influence of physicochemical parameters on the abundance and structure of common species assemblages 
of juvenile fish in the bay using an ordination approach based on canonical correspondence analysis.
